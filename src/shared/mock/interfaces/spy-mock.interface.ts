 * @remarks
 * This type is useful for filtering out index signatures from types, especially when working

 * When an object has an index signature (e.g., `[key: string]: any`), TypeScript assumes that all
 * possible string or number keys exist on the object. This utility type filters out such keys,
 * leaving only explicitly defined properties.
